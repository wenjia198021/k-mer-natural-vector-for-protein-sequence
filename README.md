# k-mer-natural-vector-for-protein-sequence

All the datasets and matlab code used in the paper of "Phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences based on a novel k-mer natural vector method".

How to get the NJ phylogenetic tree based on the dataset (hrv/beta_globin/influenza_1163) and matlab code: 

Step 1. Put the dataset (hrv.fasta/beta_globin.fasta/influenza_1163.fasta) and matlab under the software of Matlab;

Step 2. Run the code and construct a .meg file named "kmer_natural_vector_for_hrv.meg" for the dataset of "hrv.fasta";

Step 3. Open the .meg file with Mega software (such as MEGA 6.06), and choose the construct/Test Neighbour-Joining Tree ..., you can get a NJ phylogenetic tree for the dataset of hrv.fasta.
